# About

The app is a POC created by integrating Chess.js for rules, Chessboard.js for the board and UI, and Stockfish 16 for chess engine

You can play 2-player chess, with standard chess rules.

Limitations:
- No clock
- No scoring
- Both players have to play on the same window
- No history and state (The board resets when reloaded)
